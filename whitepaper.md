## Abstract

Rupaya is a grassroots initiative leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology to tackle financial inclusion challenges in South Asia. By launching localized stablecoins like PKRT (Pakistani Rupee Token), INRT (Indian Rupee Token), BDTT (Bangladeshi Taka Token), LKRT (Sri Lankan Rupee Token), NPRT (Nepalese Rupee Token), BTNRT (Bhutanese Ngultrum Token), and MVRRT (Maldivian Rufiyaa Token), Rupaya aims to provide an accessible, efficient, and secure financial ecosystem. This whitepaper outlines Rupaya's vision, strategy, and technical implementation, highlighting the project's potential to transform the financial landscape of South Asia while remaining Shariah-compliant and true to its cypherpunk roots.

## Introduction

### Vision

Rupaya's vision is to empower the people of South Asia by providing decentralized financial solutions that eliminate the dependency on traditional banking systems and centralized stablecoins like USDT. By introducing localized stablecoins, Rupaya aims to:
- Facilitate easier and cheaper transactions.
- Enhance financial inclusion.
- Support local economies.
- Foster community-driven financial ecosystems.
- Promote financial sovereignty and reduce reliance on external financial systems.

### Mission

Our mission is to leverage the power of blockchain and DeFi to create a robust, transparent, and decentralized financial infrastructure catering to South Asian users' unique needs. By utilizing the Rupaya EVM chain and other compatible blockchains, we aim to build a comprehensive ecosystem that supports various financial services, including:
- Peer-to-peer trading and transfers
- Collateralized lending and borrowing
- Yield farming and staking opportunities
- Remittance services
- Microfinance solutions for small businesses and entrepreneurs

Through these services, Rupaya seeks to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging world of decentralized finance, providing users with greater control over their financial lives.

## Problem Statement

### Financial Exclusion

A significant portion of the South Asian population remains unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to essential financial services. According to the World Bank's Global Findex Database 2021:
- In Bangladesh, only 53% of adults have a bank account
- In Pakistan, the figure stands at 21%
- In India, while 80% have bank accounts, many remain underserved

Traditional banking systems are often slow, expensive, and inaccessible to many due to geographical, regulatory, and economic barriers. This exclusion limits economic opportunities and perpetuates cycles of poverty.

### Dependency on Centralized Stablecoins

South Asian traders and users frequently rely on centralized stablecoins like USDT for their transactions. This dependency leads to several issues:
- Higher costs due to multiple conversion steps (local currency to USDT, USDT to other cryptocurrencies)
- Slower transactions, especially when moving funds between centralized exchanges
- Exposure to the risks associated with centralized control, including potential freezing of assets
- Vulnerability to global market fluctuations that may not reflect local economic conditions

### Regulatory Challenges and Shariah Compliance

Navigating the complex regulatory landscapes in South Asian countries poses significant challenges for deploying traditional financial solutions. Each country has its own set of regulations regarding cryptocurrencies and digital assets, creating a fragmented market. Moreover, there is a critical need to ensure that financial services are Shariah-compliant, avoiding any form of RIBA (interest) and adhering to Islamic financial principles. This is particularly important in countries with large Muslim populations, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.

### Limited Access to DeFi Opportunities

While the global DeFi ecosystem has experienced tremendous growth, access to these opportunities remains limited for many South Asian users due to:
- Lack of localized solutions that cater to specific regional needs
- High entry barriers in terms of technical knowledge and capital requirements
- Limited integration with local payment systems and currencies

## Solution

### Localized Stablecoins

Rupaya will introduce a suite of localized stablecoins for each South Asian country:
- PKRT (Pakistani Rupee Token)
- INRT (Indian Rupee Token)
- BDTT (Bangladeshi Taka Token)
- LKRT (Sri Lankan Rupee Token)
- NPRT (Nepalese Rupee Token)
- BTNRT (Bhutanese Ngultrum Token)
- MVRRT (Maldivian Rufiyaa Token)

These stablecoins will be pegged to their respective local currencies, providing a stable and reliable medium of exchange. The stability mechanism will be implemented through a combination of collateralization and algorithmic methods, ensuring that each token maintains its peg to the local currency.

#### Stability Mechanisms

To maintain the peg of each localized stablecoin, Rupaya will employ a multi-faceted approach:

1. **Collateralization**: A portion of each stablecoin will be backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets held in smart contracts.

2. **Algorithmic Stabilization**: An algorithmic mechanism will adjust the supply of stablecoins based on market demand, helping to maintain the peg.

3. **Liquidity Pools**: Decentralized liquidity pools will be established to facilitate easy conversion between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, helping to maintain price stability.

4. **Reserve Fund**: A portion of transaction fees will be allocated to a reserve fund, which can be used to defend the peg in times of extreme market volatility.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Solutions

Leveraging DeFi platforms, Rupaya will offer a comprehensive suite of financial services:

#### Collateralized Lending and Borrowing

Users can collateralize their crypto assets to mint stablecoins or access loans. These services will be structured to comply with Shariah principles, using concepts such as Murabaha (cost-plus financing) and Ijara (leasing) to avoid interest-based transactions.

#### P2P Trading

A decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform will facilitate direct exchanges between users, allowing for:
- Direct stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades (e.g., PKRT to INRT)
- Stablecoin to cryptocurrency trades
- Fiat-to-stablecoin trades through integration with local payment systems

#### Liquidity Pools and Yield Farming

Users can provide liquidity to decentralized pools and earn rewards in the form of transaction fees and additional tokens. This will be structured in a Shariah-compliant manner, with rewards based on actual profits from trading activities rather than predetermined interest rates.

#### Remittance Services

Leveraging the speed and low cost of blockchain transactions, Rupaya will offer a remittance service that allows users to send money across borders quickly and cheaply using localized stablecoins.

#### Microfinance and SME Lending

Rupaya will develop Shariah-compliant microfinance solutions to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. This may include:
- Mudarabah-based profit-sharing investments
- Musharakah-based partnerships for business financing
